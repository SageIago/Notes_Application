- **Unique Note IDs**: Each note is assigned a unique ID using `uuidv4`.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with Bootstrap for a consistent look across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Used for routing to navigate between pages.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type-checking to improve code reliability and maintainability.
- **uuidv4**: Generates unique IDs for each note.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides responsive and reusable CSS components.
